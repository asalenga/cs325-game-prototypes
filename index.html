<h2>Busy Street</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
There is a simple goal: cross to the other side. Nearly all of the code is my own.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
It uses the directional buttons on the keyboard
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
It resembles Frogger or Crossy Road
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
Successfully cross the road without dying.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
I didn't use any themes. I just used my own choice of images and mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
Input: keyboard
Randomness: Spawn locations of the boxes
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
To excercise caution while simultaneously showing quick thinking to cross to the other side.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
	The player can move the character in four directions: up, down, left, and right. This is done by inputting movement commands via the arrow keys on the keyboard. Since this is a prototype, enemy speed, spacing, and movement are predictable. Modifications would make their movements more random.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
Using the spaces in between enemy rows to stop and reevaluate would be useful.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
	The game is simple and has very little story: a character is trying to cross a busy street. He is trying to reach the beach on the other side of the street.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
There is no specific audience.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
Approximately 1 minute.
</li>
