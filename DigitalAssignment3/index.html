<h2>Angled Angel</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game features an angel flying through the sky and trying to avoid the lightning and thunderclouds.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Since the angel moves toward the mouse pointer, there is an extra challenge to avoid the dangers.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to integrate multiple states, as well as use the syntax in doing so. The hardest part of making the game was learning the syntax. The syntax for this game involved different ways of declaring functions and including different classes, so it was a challenge to know the details in the files.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used a template, and used code for the movement from the default Phaser example, but the rest of the program is my own.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
An angel is trying to fly through the skies through a dangerous thunderstorm.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
A person with wings
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The stormcloud positions are randomized, the mouse is used for input.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This evaluates the movement and collision of sprites, as well as the use of multiple game states.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To experience an unconventional way of moving through a playing field.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move the angel by moving the mouse. The angel cannot hit a cloud or lightning, or else they lose. The angel is bounded by the screen, and it accelerates towards the mouse pointer.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
An angel is trying to get to a destination, perhaps his home in Heaven, but is met with an unforseen storm. The angel must fly through the turbulent skies to hopefully survive.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is fairly simple to play, but difficult to win, so it could be for anyone who likes a challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than 5 minutes.
</li>
